/*
Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array).
Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length.
What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.

You couldn't cut wood into float length.

If you couldn't get >= k pieces, return 0.

Have you met this question in a real interview?
Example
For L=[232, 124, 456], k=7, return 114.

Challenge
O(n log Len), where Len is the longest length of the wood.
