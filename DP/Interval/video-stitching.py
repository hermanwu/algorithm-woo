'''
You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted T seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied lengths.

Each video clip clips[i] is an interval: it starts at time clips[i][0] and ends at time clips[i][1]. We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments [0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7].

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event ([0, T]). If the task is impossible, return -1.

Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].
