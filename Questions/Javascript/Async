What order does f receive its arguments?

f("foo");
setTimeout(function() { f("bar");}, 0);
f("barz");


Create a promise:

var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
   if () {
       resolve(
   }

});

how would set the data from a callback and return it to screen?

function greeting(response) {
    alert('Hello ' + name);
}

function networkRequest(callback) {

    // network request
    $http.test.$promise.then(success, failure);
}


if this was returned in a promise how would you do?
