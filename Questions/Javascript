1. What is the difference between double-equals and triple-equals

==: Abstract Equality Comparison
===: Strict Equality Comparison


var num = 0;
var obj = new String('0');
var str = '0';

console.log(num == num); // true
console.log(obj == obj); // true
console.log(str == str); // true

console.log(num == obj); // true
console.log(num == str); // true
console.log(obj == str); // true
console.log(null == undefined); // true

// both false, except in rare cases
console.log(obj == null);
console.log(obj == undefined);


2. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions

3. AJAX

Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

    a. why whould you use it?
    b. what patterns can we use to wait on an aysnchronous response?

 1. Promise:

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation,
and its resulting value.

new Promise( /* executor */ function(resolve, reject) { ... } );

Three states: fulfilled, rejected, pending

        observables,
        Async/awaitï¼›

4. What is a closure?
    a. why would you use one?

5. Explain how prototypal inheritance works.

6. Explain how function parameters are passed.
    a. Primitives vs Objects.
    b. Call-by-sharing means everything is passed by value but Object properties have a reference to the object.

7. Explain event bubbling:
    a. I attach an on-click handler to a DIV element.
    b. That handler sets the DIV to display: none when clicked.
    c. I also attach an on-click event handler to a Button element within the DIV.
    d. That click handler provides a alert with instructions for the page.
    e. What happens when I click the BUTTON element?

8 How can we keep our code from leaking into the global scope?

9 Tell me about the browser's event loop
    a. What can I use to avoid blocking the main thread with long-running operations?
        i. Web workers
    b. Tell me about the difference between the call stack and task queue.
