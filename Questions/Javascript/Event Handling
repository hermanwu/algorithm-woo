Suppose we have a page with a button inside a div.
We then execute the following Javascript. What will the console read after the button is clicked?

$(‘div’).on(‘click’, function() {
    console.log(‘div clicked’);
});
$(‘button’).click(function() {
    console.log(‘button clicked’);
});


Explain event bubbling:
    a. I attach an on-click handler to a DIV element.
    b. That handler sets the DIV to display: none when clicked.
    c. I also attach an on-click event handler to a Button element within the DIV.
    d. That click handler provides a alert with instructions for the page.
    e. What happens when I click the BUTTON element?
