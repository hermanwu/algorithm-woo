1. What is the difference between double-equals and triple-equals

==: Abstract Equality Comparison
===: Strict Equality Comparison


var num = 0;
var obj = new String('0');
var str = '0';

console.log(num == num); // true
console.log(obj == obj); // true
console.log(str == str); // true

console.log(num == obj); // true
console.log(num == str); // true
console.log(obj == str); // true
console.log(null == undefined); // true

// both false, except in rare cases
console.log(obj == null);
console.log(obj == undefined);


2. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions

3. AJAX

Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

a. Why would you use it?
b. what patterns can we use to wait on an asynchronous response?

 1. Promise:

    The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation,
    and its resulting value.

    new Promise( /* executor */ function(resolve, reject) { ... } );

    Three states: fulfilled, rejected, pending

a. observables,

c. async / await

4. What is a closure?

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

    a. why would you use one?

        protect private variable


5. Explain how prototypal inheritance works.

6. Explain how function parameters are passed.
    a. Primitives vs Objects.
    b. Call-by-sharing means everything is passed by value but Object properties have a reference to the object.
