828. Word Pattern
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

Example
Given pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog", return true.
Given pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish", return false.
Given pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog", return false.
Given pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog", return false.

Notice
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.
