75. Find Peak Element
There is an integer array which has the following features:

The numbers in adjacent positions are different.
A[0] < A[1] && A[A.length - 2] > A[A.length - 1].
We define a position P is a peak if:

A[P] > A[P-1] && A[P] > A[P+1]
Find a peak element in this array. Return the index of the peak.

Example
Given [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6]

Return index 1 (which is number 2) or 6 (which is number 7)

Challenge
Time complexity O(logN)
