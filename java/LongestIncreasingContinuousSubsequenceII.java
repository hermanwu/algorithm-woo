 398. Longest Increasing Continuous subsequence II

 Give you an integer matrix (with row size n, column size m)ï¼Œfind the longest increasing continuous subsequence in this matrix.
 (The definition of the longest increasing continuous subsequence here can start at any row or column and go up/down/right/left any direction).

 Example

 Given a matrix:

 [
 [1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5],
 [16,17,24,23,6],
 [15,18,25,22,7],
 [14,19,20,21,8],
 [13,12,11,10,9]
 ]
 return 25

 Challenge

 O(nm) time and memory.
