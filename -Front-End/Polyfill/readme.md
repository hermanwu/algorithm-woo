what is polyfill?

A polyfill is a piece of code (usually Javascript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

- for better functionality and better performance.
- Native implementations of APIs can do more and are faster.
- address browsers implement same features in different ways.
