- HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS), although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protocol secures communications by using whatâ€™s known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure. This type of security system uses two different keys to encrypt communications between two parties:
- 
- It is a protocol
- secure version of HTTP
- everything is encrypted
