/**

 Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers
 and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

 For example, given n = 2, return 1 (2 = 1 + 1); given n = 10, return 36 (10 = 3 + 3 + 4).

 Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.

    /*

    If an optimal product contains a factor f >= 4, then you can replace it with factors 2 and f-2 without losing optimality, as 2*(f-2) = 2f-4 >= f. So you never need a factor greater than or equal to 4, meaning you only need factors 1, 2 and 3 (and 1 is of course wasteful and you’d only use it for n=2 and n=3, where it’s needed).

    For the rest I agree, 3*3 is simply better than 2*2*2, so you’d never use 2 more than twice.
