/**
 Given a non-empty 2D matrix matrix and an integer k,
 find the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.

 Given matrix = [
 [1,  0, 1],
 [0, -2, 3]
 ]
 k = 2

 The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
 What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
