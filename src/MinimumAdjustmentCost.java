/**
 Given an integer array, adjust each integers so that the difference of every adjacent integers are not greater than a given number target.

 If the array before adjustment is A, the array after adjustment is B, you should minimize the sum of |A[i]-B[i]|

 Exampleï¼š

 Given [1,4,2,3] and target = 1, one of the solutions is [2,3,2,3], the adjustment cost is 2 and it's minimal.

 Return 2.
