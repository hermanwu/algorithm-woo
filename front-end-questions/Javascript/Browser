Tell me about the browser's event loop

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop

    a. What can I use to avoid blocking the main thread with long-running operations?
        i. Web workers

    b. Tell me about the difference between the call stack and task queue.
        a job queue is a queue of things to do (usually store persistant) and a call stack is a stack of routines

        timeout(function(){
            console.log("one");
        }, 100);

        console.log("two");
        in call stack, console.log("one") is triggered first,
        but in job queue, the result will display after two.


How can we keep our code from leaking into the global scope?
    module loader / requirejs
    immediately invoked function expression
