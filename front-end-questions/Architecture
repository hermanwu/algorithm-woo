What patterns do you use to organize your code?
    a. Module, prototype, observer, singleton
    b. How can you make JS functions and properties private vs. public?

What are the benefits of services / singleton?

Tell me about a reusable component you've written.

What is functional programming:
    * building software by composing pure functions
        * Pure function: given the same inputs, always returns the same output.
    * declarative rather than imperative
    * application state flows through pure functions
    * function composition
